# Drupal Cookbook

This cookbook installs and configures Drupal. 

I use it primarily as a dependency on projects and for local (Vagrant) development.

# Requirements

## Vagrant

To use this cookbook with Vagrant, you obviously need Vagrant and VirtualBox installed. Additionally, install these two plugins:

* `vagrant plugin install vagrant-berkshelf`
* `vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus`

# Usage
